# STK Mission Analysis Scenarios

Collection of STK scenarios demonstrating satellite mission planning, trajectory optimization, and coverage analysis capabilities.

## Scenarios

**Coverage Analysis**
Global and regional coverage modeling for Earth observation satellites across multiple orbital configurations. Includes constraint-based grid analysis and coverage optimization.

**Astrogator Mission Design**  
Launch vehicle trajectory simulation from liftoff through LEO insertion, transfer orbit injection, and final GEO placement. Includes delta-V budget analysis and burn duration calculations.

**Analysis Workbench**
Custom vector geometry, temporal constraints, and calculation tools for satellite tracking and sensor visibility analysis.

**Communications & Radar**
RF link analysis and radar performance modeling for satellite communication systems.
